# odin-recipes
1st project on Odin
First assignment on Odin Project with the aim of creating a structure of a recipe website.

Using the html tags learned from the previous lessons and some git commands, created a website structure that links a user to recipes of a particular dish desired.

The recipes are stored on a repository named 'recipes' and also included photos in the recipes websites and so had to create a repository for the images as well.

The Recipes structure are all identical so after creating the second one the third one wasn't that hard.
Still trying ti get used to the Git commands on how and when to actually use them to make sense.
